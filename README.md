# Combine HTML Tree
With this tool you can concatenate multiple HTML files to a single big HTML 
file. The order is configurable in certain setting files and can either be 
found in a folder and subfolders or a custom set of files.

The files don't really have to be HTML either, they can be PHP, txt or any 
other non-binary files.

## Who is this for?
I like HTML files and use them for many things: step by step instructions for 
myself to remember how to configure stuff, meeting notes etc. They are so easy 
to style with CSS and they are very portable &mdash; everyone has a web 
browser, don't they? 

Unfortunately, many of these documents get quite large and it can become 
difficult to find my way to the specific section I want to edit (even with 
search functionality). Therefore, I've come up with the idea that it would be 
neat if I could have my large documents in multiple files (one per heading, 
for example), and just combine them when I'm done editing.

If you also like to write a lot of large HTML documents, this tool might be 
for you.
